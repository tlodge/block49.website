                <h2><strong>What</strong> is roomcast?</h2>
                <span> building based communication </span>
                <p>It's a tool that helps you send messages to specific neighbours without any fuss.  It's based on a gloriously simple and powerful observation: <strong>neighbours would like to send messages to apartments, floors and buildings, to car owners and landlords </strong>.  They should be able to do this without consolting a managing agent or concierge and without needing to know or see email addresses or phone numbers.   Roomcast will get messages to the places that they'll be seen; not defunct residents forums and groups or long-gone tenants, but to the channels that reflect the preferences of each individual recipient.  We believe communication in buildings should de-emphasise relationships (it's not always a good idea to get to know each other) and concentrate on practicalities.
                </p>
                <h2><strong>Why</strong> do we need it?</h2>
                    <p>Where do we start?  Imagine you could send a message to all residents on your floor.  Or to the landlord of apartment seven.  Or to the owner of the car with registration xyz.  Imagine if you could broadcast a message to all groundfloor apartments of all adjacent developments or to the apartment whose towels are about to blow off the balcony.    Imagine you want to issue a rallying cry to all leaseholders in your block or to alert your block about a recent crime.  All of this should be standard for all developments.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2><strong>Anything</strong> else? </h2>
                    <p>
                    Yes.  Such a facility is simply too powerful and useful to exist as a single messaging tool.  We think that it gets even more exciting if applications as well as people can communicate in this way.  For this reason, roomcast will come with a clean and concise API so that innovative new tools can leverage the notions of building oriented messaging.
                    </p>    
                    <h2><strong>I love it!</strong> How can I get involved?</h2>
                    <p>We'll be alpha testing roomcast in the next few months.  We have a couple of great high-rise communities who want to be the first to give this a go. We plan to push out an app and an API, so that other developers can hook into roomcast and do things that we've not yet thought of.  If, like us, you can see the potential of roomcast, then we're looking for a small amount of capital to help us accelerate the project.</p>
