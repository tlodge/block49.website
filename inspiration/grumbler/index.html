                <h2><strong>What</strong> is grumbler?</h2>
                <span> reporting triage</span>
                <p>
                Grumbler is a tool that routes your problem to the right place.  In large scale properties, the person or institution responsible for tackling a problem is not always obvious.  It may be the managing agent, an owner, a landlord, a contractor, the freeholder, the council, a developer a residents' association member, a letting agent or someone else.  Grumbler is designed to make problem reporting more efficient and fruitful.   
          
                </p>
                <h2><strong>Why</strong> do we need it?</h2>
                 The first port of call for owners facing problems with their development will often be their management company. For tenants it is their landlord or letting agency.   In the best case, if the responsibility lies elsewhere, the management company or landlord will simply pass it on.  But we've seen many cases where problem reports disappear into the ether, are dismissed or met with bad advice.   Who best to contact for noise nuisance, a poorly cleaned foyer, a pothole on a development's boundary, a badly parked car or crime wave?  Grumbler will take care of this detail for you.                         
                <h2>How does it work</h2>
                <p>
                Every development will have a different set of reporting channels, whether informal or formal.  Grumbler allows you to make these more explicit and to develop a set of rules that fit the needs of your development.  It will collect statistics on similar issues and track whether the current reporting channels are effective.
