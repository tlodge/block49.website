                <h2><strong>What</strong> is apples?</h2>
                <span> bring clarity to comparison complexity</span>
                <p>Apples is a tool that helps you compare service charges and energy bills.    Large residential developments are complex.  Although many apartments (and buildings) share many similarities, it is supremely difficult to obtain meaningful (apples with apples) comparisons across service charges and energy bills.  This tool will allow you to both compare your costs against similar developments and give an indication as to whether they appear to be reasonable. </p>
                
                <h2><strong>Why</strong> do we need it?</h2>
                <p> 
                Unfortunately we cannot always be certain that that charges we pay for the day to day running of our developments are competitive or even fair.   There's little incentive from a managing agent's point of view to make this easier for us (it has even been suggested that in a few cases this is made deliberately hard!).  Commissions, kickbacks and inefficiencies can hide behind the complexity of large scale property management.  These are hard to prove and harder to challenge (the obligation falls to leaseholders to demonstrate that costs are 'unreasonable' before much can be done).    This is all about giving managing agents the means to demonstrate that they're being fair (which we hasten to add that, in our opinion many ARE), and to give you the confidence that you're paying what you should.</p>
                
                <h2><strong>How</strong> will it work?</h2>
                <p> 
                There's a body of research out there that lives and breathes problems far more complex than this; information science considers how relationships between pairs of data can be extracted and interpreted.  Work on the semantic web has considered how information can be modelled and structured to allow data sharing and re-use.  We expect that common techniques can be applied to this problem with great effect.
                </p>
                <h2><strong>Like</strong> it?</h2> 
                <p>
                We want to work with the best lawyers, conveyancers and managing agents to help clean some of this mess.  Technology can play a far more useful role in bringing back a little clarity to the service charge fog.
