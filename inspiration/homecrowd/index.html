                <h2><strong>What</strong> is homecrowd?</h2>
                <span> community funding</span>
                <p>
                    We have witnessed far too many cases where residents in developments have failed to work to a mutually agreeable goal.  The homecrowd is a tool that helps residents to propose projects and raise capital.  It's a kickstarter for large scale developments.

                <h2><strong>How</strong> does it work?</h2>
                  
                  
                <p>
                     Simple.  Any one resident can propose a project, a funding target and timescale.  Community pot handles the rest.  It will advertise the project within a chosen scope (it doesn't need to be something that is relevant to just one development).  It will handle the collection of money, track how close you are to reaching your target, handle the final disbursement of funds (or hand back any money if the target is not reached).

                <h2><strong>Feel</strong> the power</h2>
                 <p>
                    It is hard for residents work together to fund a project or coordinate around a particular task, especially when costs fall outside the remit of service charges.  The homecrowd simplifies all this.  But there are other implications. Poorly performing managing agents or malicious freeholders are notoriously hard to hold to account.  Sadly, the last resort is to take a case to tribunal.  This can be expensive and intimidating.  Community pot gives residents the facility to fight their cause and spread financial risk.  Feel the power.

                 <h2><strong>Anything</strong> else?</h2>
                 <p>
                    It's not just money that stops promising projects from reaching fruition.  It's complexity too.  We've been analysing the needs of residential communities for many years and have watched them battle bewildering complexity.  We're building tools to alleviate this burden.  And when these connect with the homecrowd (they will!), then we'll be able to share ideas and provide pathways between similar developments.
