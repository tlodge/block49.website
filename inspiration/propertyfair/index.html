                <p>

Propertyfair is (another!)  way for you to sell or let your flat.  But it is different.  PropertyFair <strong> gets to know your development.</strong>  In doing so it cleverly reuses information to help you get your property on the market with blistering speed and un-rivalled simplicity.  And because of all of the efficiency gains and a clever use of resources, it can out-compete Estate Agent's prices several times over.  Propertyfair offers innovative help with negotiating a deal and showing people around (it doesn't need to be you!).  But it also recognises the role of decent Estate Agents; it allows you to hook into their services at any time. </p>


<h2><strong>Why another</strong> online property site?</h2>
<p>
PropertyFair is all about large scale properties and the communities within them.  In large scale properties there are efficiency gains that are simply not being exploited to the benefit of owners. What's more, a staggering amount of money will leave a development as properties are let and sold.  PropertyFair is being designed around the interests of owners and their development's community.  
</p>

<h2><strong>Anything</strong> else? </h2>
<p>
For now, we're all about efficiency gains.  But there's some interesting scope for involving neighbours in the selling and letting process.  You may be living near to someone who can do a far better job of selling your property than any estate agent.  If that's the case, why not have them show people round for you?  They can earn well from it if they manage to complete a deal (and far less than an estate agent's commission), and all can be managed and tracked online.  Should a little of the money that comes from buying and selling feed back into the development's community?

We see this as a community-lead enterprise - we have some good ideas (we think), but we're hungry for feedback. We're also looking for sponsors and have some interesting ideas on how this might work.  Get in contact with us if you're interested.
